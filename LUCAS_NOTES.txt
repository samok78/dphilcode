Hi Lucas -

What you see here is an old validation script that was designed to work with the old input files.

I want to make a similar validation script that works with the new input files. This script should:

-read in model files
-build ensembles of the files for each year

CYCLE
-Average over all years so that you can see value per month for every ensemble
-Compare to CHIRPS

TIMESERIES
-Average over each month so you get time series in every year for each ensemble member
-Compare to CHIRPS

BIAS
-Compare monthly averages over entire time period for each ensemble member.
-Subtract CHIRPS monthly averages over same time period.

Q-Q
-NOT SURE WHAT MAKES SENSE. COMPARE SEASONAL AVERAGE RAINFALL OVER ALL YEARS FOR EACH ENSEMBLE WITH CHIRPS. HEAVY LINE FOR ENS MEAN VS CHIRPS

HISTOGRAM
-Probably compare all values with all values in CHIRPS
